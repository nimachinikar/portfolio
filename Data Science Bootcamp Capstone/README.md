## Introduction

Hey there! 👋 During a 3-month Data Science Bootcamp by BrainStation, I worked on an exciting final project focusing on predicting the prices of Airbnb in Vancouver. The goal of this project was to leverage data science techniques to gain insights into the factors influencing rental prices and develop an accurate predictive model. The project aims to benefit both hosts and travelers in the competitive short-term rental market by providing valuable pricing strategies and informed decision-making.

## Project Highlights

- Explored the factors influencing Airbnb rental prices in Vancouver.
- Developed a predictive model to accurately estimate listing prices.
- Identified key amenities that tend to command higher prices.
- Created informative visualizations and analysis in Jupyter notebooks.

## Folder Structure

The project repository has the following folder structure:

- 📁 `documentations`: Contains a detailed report summarizing the project and a lighter version for presentations.
- 📁 `images`: Stores key images used in the documentation and presentation.
- 📁 `source`: Holds the original dataset used for analysis.

The main Jupyter files are:

- 📝 [PreProcessing](https://github.com/nimachinikar/portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Science%20Bootcamp%20Capstone/1_DataPreProcessing.ipynb): Data preprocessing notebook.
- 📝 [EDA](https://github.com/nimachinikar/portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Science%20Bootcamp%20Capstone/2_EDA.ipynb): Exploratory Data Analysis notebook.
- 📝 [PreModeling](https://github.com/nimachinikar/portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Science%20Bootcamp%20Capstone/3_PreModeling.ipynb): Notebook for preparing data for modeling.
- 📝 [Modeling & Interpretation](https://github.com/nimachinikar/portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Science%20Bootcamp%20Capstone/4_Modeling.ipynb): Contains the model building and interpretation.

To run the entire project, you can execute the `4_Modeling.ipynb` notebook, which will automatically launch all dependent scripts.
