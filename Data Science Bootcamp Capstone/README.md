<h1> Hey there!  </h1>
<h2> üåü During 3 months, I took part in a Data Science bootcamp by BrainStation and this is my final project  </h2>
<h3> About the the project </h3>
The underlying question of this project is to predict the prices of Airbnb listings in Vancouver accurately. 
By applying data science techniques, the goal is to understand the factors influencing rental prices and develop a model that adds business and societal value. 
This project aims to benefit both hosts and travelers in the competitive short-term rental market by providing insights into optimal pricing strategies and informed decision-making.

Our analysis revealed that the number of bathrooms, accommodation capacity, and availability are the primary factors influencing the price of properties. 
Moreover, properties offering amenities such as a dishwasher, shampoo, refrigerator, and a dedicated workspace tend to command higher prices.

<h3>üí°  The folder structure: </h3>

-  &nbsp; On the main page, you can find 4 Jupyter files. If you want to run them, you can just run the 4_Modeling. It will launch all dependant scripts. (*)
-  &nbsp; Each Jupyter notebook saves the transformations applied in outputs and saves a python script in executables
-  &nbsp; Key Images are saved in images
-  &nbsp; The folder 'documentations' contains a report summarizing the project. It also contains a lighter version of the former meant for presentation.
-  &nbsp; Source contains the original dataset
