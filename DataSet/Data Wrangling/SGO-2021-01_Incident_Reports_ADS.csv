While driving along [XXX] under autonomous control, the shuttle encountered a parked vehicle partially blocking its path, requiring disengagement of the autonomous drive system.  The safety driver attempted to manually drive the shuttle around the parked vehicle to reengage the autonomous drive system.  While manually steering the shuttle around the parked vehicle blocking its path, the shuttle failed to respond to manual control input and steered to the left, impacting a parked vehicle at a low rate of speed on the opposite side of [XXX].  The six passengers onboard alighted the shuttle, an accident report was filed with the local police, and the shuttle was removed from the scene.  Initial reports from the onboard safety driver indicated that while steering around the vehicle blocking the shuttle's path, the shuttle became unresponsive to control input.  The safety driver released the operator present button on the vehicle controller, which serves as dead man switch however, the vehicle failed to stop.  After the incident, further investigation by Navya confirmed that the root cause of the incident was a failure of the Xbox 360 controller used to manually control the vehicle.  Contact with the parked vehicle occurred between the time of failure and the vehicle drive system recognizing that the controller had failed an elapsed time of 4.05 seconds. In response to the incident, Beep suspended operation of all Navya ARMA vehicles pending identification and implementation of appropriate solutions to mitigate the risk of this failure leading to future incidents.
Subsequent investigation by Beep and Navya determined that the vehicle control software, NavyaDrive, is limited in its ability to monitor the validity of control signal input received from the Xbox 360 controller.  As the safety driver began to manually steer the vehicle, the controller failed, sending constant turning input to the vehicle drive system leading to the collision.  Though Navya developed software mitigations due to prior issues encountered with the controller, those mitigations were ineffective with respect to the failure leading to the incident on December [XXX].  Further, due to the short time between the controller failing and the collision (2.34sec), the safety driver was unable to identify the controller failure and trigger the emergency stop before the collision occurred.
In response to the incident, Navya is integrating a revised manual control system on the ARMA shuttle platform.  The revised manual control system utilizes industrial-grade components for improved electromechanical reliability and allows for active monitoring of the control system health, eliminating the root cause of the failure that led to the incident on December [XXX].  Software upgrades of all Navya ARMA vehicles will further reintroduce automated braking function while the ARMA vehicle is under manual control.  Beep is working with Navya to retrofit its fleet of ARMA vehicles with the revised manual control system as well as retrain and recertify its safety driver staff on the updated NavyaDrive software.
Discussion of the root cause analysis and solution design for the revised manual control system will be provided to NHTSA as a supplement to this report.",

Subject vehicle approached a red light to make a right turn East-bound onto [XXX].  The safety operator suggested that the safety driver disengage the ADS and make the turn in manual mode because the vehicle was hesitant in approaching the intersection. The safety driver disengaged the ADS, and, approximately 250ms later, subject vehicle was lightly struck from behind by a white Mazda3.  Having seen debris on the roadway, the driver and operator believed they had run over a rock and did not realize they were hit by the vehicle. After concluding the mission, the driver and operator found damage to a sensor during an inspection.  A subsequent review of video led to discovery of the crash.  No injuries were reported, and law enforcement was not called to the scene.  
In addition to telematics and video, we also have photographs of the vehicle's damaged sensor.",

TuSimple's position is that this event does not meet the criteria for reporting under the SGO.
Specifically, the L4 ADS was not in operation at any point in the 30 seconds prior to making contact with the concrete barrier.
The event occurred as follows:
As the truck was being operated on the highway, within its mapped ODD, the driver and test engineer attempted to engage the ADS.
However, the ADS was not functional at that moment due to the computer unit not having been initialized, and should not have been
attempted to be activated. In short, this was a failed attempt to engage the system as a result of human error.
The system has now been modified to prevent the ADS from attempting to engage unless the health of the system is fully functional to
prevent human error from repeating this event.
When the erroneous attempt to engage occurred, the uninitialized vehicle control unit rotated the steering to the left, causing the truck to
veer left. The safety driver took control of the steering, and was able to steer accordingly, but not before the left front truck tire and left
front quarter panel came into contact with the concrete barrier to the left of the lanes of travel.",

The May vehicle's ground mapping module had fallen significantly behind in its processing of lidar data. As a result, actual objects were being filtered out of the lidar data during object detection. This filtering caused the truck to oscillate between being detected, detecting only the cab, detecting the cab and mirror, and not being detected at all.
After assessing the issue, it has been determined that ground map latency alone will not cause safety issues. There is no risk to VRUs, or anything at ground level. The issue was with something in the air (mirror), above the ground.
A permanent fix to address the ground map latency issue is in process and will be implemented in the entire fleet within the next 30 days.
The second factor in the collision is that we were artificially constraining the vehicle to the right side of the road due to ambiguous and unpainted roadway. If we change that constraint to an advisory line (and allow the vehicle to cross the line to the left), we would have been far enough to the left to avoid collision (simulation success).
Solution Implementation: AVO training for extra caution related to protruding items like mirrors (short term), software changes coming in the next update and hotfix (within 30 days), and further improvement in the following update (within 60 days).
Until the tested software changes are implemented, we have advised the AVOs to take extra caution in these scenarios and to continue to disengage autonomy when desired. As always, we sacrifice autonomy for safety, as needed.",

Specifically, the L4 ADS was not in operation at any point in the 30 seconds prior to making contact with the concrete barrier.  
 
The event occurred as follows:
As the truck was being operated on the highway, within its mapped ODD, the driver and test engineer attempted to engage the ADS.  However, the ADS was not functional at that moment due to the computer unit not having been initialized, and should not have been attempted to be activated.  In short, this was a failed attempt to engage the system as a result of human error.  
 
The system has now been modified to prevent the ADS from attempting to engage unless the health of the system is fully functional to prevent human error from repeating this event.
 
When the erroneous attempt to engage occurred, the uninitialized vehicle control unit rotated the steering to the left, causing the truck to veer left.  The safety driver took control of the steering, and was able to steer accordingly, but not before the left front truck tire and left front quarter panel came into contact with the concrete barrier to the left of the lanes of travel.  
 
The contact resulted in a scuff to the left tire and damage to the radar unit extending from the left quarter panel.",

As the Cruise AV began to enter the intersection, the red SUV made a prohibited left turn onto [XXX] from the middle lane on [XXX], across both the left lane in which the Cruise AV was traveling and a lefthand turn lane. The Cruise AV braked to avoid the SUV turning into its lane and, shortly thereafter, the red SUV made contact with the Cruise AV, damaging the passenger side fender and front facia of the Cruise AV. The driver of the red SUV left the scene without exchanging information. There were no injuries and Cruise filed a police report. [REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION]",Y

As required by the SGO, Pony.ai submitted a ""10-day"" update to the amended report on November [XXX], 2021. Subsequently, in a November [XXX], 2021 meeting with NHTSA, Pony.ai presented a full report regarding the crash and material facts and circumstances to a number of NHTSA officials, and answered the agency's questions. This supplemental ""Other"" Report is intended only to provide two minor technical corrections to Pony.ai's prior reports, in order to ensure the details of the written reports, as revised, are accurate. This is not a ""1-Day"", ""Monthly"" or ""Monthly-No Incidents"" Report. To facilitate a clear record, this ""Other"" Updated Report reproduces verbatim the narrative descriptions from the prior reports concerning this incident. 
UNEDITED NARRATIVE FROM ORIGINAL MONTHLY REPORT (11/[XXX]/21) AND AMENDED REPORT (11/[XXX]/21): On October [XXX], 2021, after turning right onto [XXX] from [XXX], the Pony.ai Autonomous Vehicle (""Pony.ai AV"") performed a left lane change maneuver in autonomous mode (SAE L4). While performing the lane change, the Pony.ai AV came into contact with a center divider on [XXX]. and the traffic sign that was posted on the divider. The Pony.ai AV suffered moderate damage to the front of the vehicle and the undercarriage. There were no injuries and no other vehicles involved. Fremont Police Department were called to report the incident and the damaged street sign. Pony.ai has subsequently worked with local authorities to resolve all issues related to the damaged sign. Please note that the latitude/longitude provided are GPS coordinates of the location address.
UNEDITED ADDITIONAL NARRATIVE FROM 10-DAY UPDATE: NHTSA has requested the Company to debrief the Agency on this incident. That meeting is scheduled for November 30, 2021.  Pony.ai will present a full updated report of the incident to NHTSA at that time and the current status of the Company's investigation.

On September [XXX], 2021 at 1:54 PM PDT, a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle ('Waymo AV') operating in Tempe, AZ was in a collision involving a pickup truck on [XXX] near [XXX]. While in autonomous mode, the Waymo AV began to enter the right lane of a protected double left turn lane (""Lane 2"") from northbound [XXX] to westbound [XXX]. A pickup truck heading southbound on [XXX] had completely crossed the double-yellow lines of the northbound double left turn lanes and positioned itself in the left lane of the double turn lane (""Lane 1"") facing the wrong direction against traffic and was preparing to make a left turn across Lane 2 and the other two northbound lanes into a shopping center parking lot on the east side of [XXX]. 
The Waymo AV was traveling in Lane 2 when the pickup truck began to initiate its left turn from Lane 1. The Waymo AV braked, and the trained human driver in the Waymo AV (in the driver's seating position), transitioned the vehicle from autonomous to manual mode. As the pickup truck made the left turn, the driver's side panels of the pickup truck made contact with the driver's side rear corner of the Waymo AV causing moderate damage to the Waymo AV. Damage to the pickup is currently unknown. At the time of contact, the Waymo AV was in manual mode.
